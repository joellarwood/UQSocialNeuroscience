# Conducting research in the lab

When beginning a new project in the lab a repository should be created for that project. This new repository should then be connected to the lab handbook repository as a submodule.

In your project repository you should document how the study steps have been conduced using the headings below (research checklist). In the repository you should also include analysis code, experimental code and stimuli and cleaned data. The repository should follow this structure
```

## Idea phase
#### What is the initial idea and what have others added to it?
#### Literature review

## Design Phase
#### What is the design?
#### What is predicted?
#### How many people are needed? Detail power analysis for relevant analyses
#### What is the method?
##### Participants
##### Stimuli
##### Measures
##### Procedure

## Coding phase
#### What coding needs to be done
#### Identify issues and fixes (with code where useful)

## Pilot Testing
#### How many people will be pilot tested
#### What are the goals of the testing
#### What issues were identified
#### How were the issues rectified

##Data analysis plan
#### What are the exclusion criteria
- outliers, non-compliance etc.
